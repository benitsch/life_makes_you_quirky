# Life Makes You Quirky
A Unity game which was developed in the [6th Klagenfurt Winter Game Jam](https://klujam.at/) (09.12.2022 - 11.12.2022).

## Make your way to the portals at the end of the level and collect the hearts (with "E") along the way.

But beware, every heart has a drawback, choose wisely which hearts you pick up. Be careful not to fall down, you won't find any hearts at the bottom of the level.
If you collect enough hearts, it will definitely be worth it ;)
Depending on how many hearts you collect, you will get different endings. So be sure to play multiple rounds.

###### Instructions:
+ **E** - Interact
+ **A/left arrow** - move left
+ **D/right arrow** - move right
+ **Space** - Jump

And most importantly:
+ **R** - Bark!
